SocialNest Where Local Services Meet Community Connections

The goal of this project was to design and develop a robust
 community-driven messaging application using Flutter for the
 frontend and Firebase for the backend. The application aimed to
 create a user-friendly platform where boutique owners and
 consumers could engage in meaningful conversations within
 distinct group environments. Additionally, the project focused on
 enabling private communication between users, enhancing user
 interaction while maintaining role-based permissions and a secure
 backend infrastructure.

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
